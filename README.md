Student Information Systems (SIS) are vital for edu
cational institutions but face challenges like outdated data management and limited accessibility. 
This report compares diverse database systems for SIS, including Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j, MongoDB, and MySQL. We assess performance, scalability, flexibility, and query capabilities within the SIS context.
We use a representative dataset with information about students, courses, grades, and academic records, with record sizes of 250,000, 500,000, 750,000, and 1 million. Multiple complex queries are executed and automated for reliable data, each test run at least 30 times.
Our findings are presented through histograms, showing response times in milliseconds. The goal is to identify the database system demonstrating superior query execution under consistent hardware and software conditions.
